
# Patamon Evolution Path for Maximum Elemental Move Coverage (Cyber Sleuth)

## Goal
Build a Seraphimon (Vaccine) with the strongest inherited moves of all elements for optimal coverage against Virus Digimon.

## Corrected Step-by-Step Evolution Path

### 1. Start: Patamon (Rookie, Vaccine, Wind)
- Learns Wind moves (Air Shot, Sonic Void I).
- These are the only Wind options available at Rookie/Champion.

### 2. Branch to Other Rookies/Champions for Strong Elemental Moves
Devolve and evolve through these lines to inherit the strongest moves:

- **Fire:** Greymon (Champion) — *Mega Flame* (stronger than Pepper Breath)
- **Plant:** Woodmon (Champion) — *Gaia Element II*
- **Water:** Ikkakumon (Champion) — *Harpoon Torpedo*
- **Electric:** Kabuterimon (Champion) — *Electro Shocker*
- **Earth:** Ankylomon (Champion) — *Tail Hammer*
- **Light:** MagnaAngemon (Ultimate) — *Holy Light III*
- **Dark:** Wizardmon (Champion) — *Hell Crusher I*

### 3. How to Inherit Moves
- Evolve Patamon into each required Rookie, then Champion, to learn the above moves.
- After learning, devolve back to Patamon and repeat for each element.
- Only inherit moves that Patamon and its evolutions can actually learn by following valid evolution lines.

### 4. Final Evolution
- Once all desired moves are inherited, evolve Patamon to Angemon (Champion), then MagnaAngemon (Ultimate), and finally Seraphimon (Mega).
- Seraphimon will have the strongest inherited moves from each element for optimal coverage.

This path ensures Seraphimon inherits the highest-power moves available from each element, using only valid evolution/devolution lines.

## Example Final Moveset (Seraphimon)
- Air Shot, Sonic Void III (Wind)
- Pepper Breath, Wolkenapalm III, Meteor Fall II (Fire)
- Poison Ivy, Gaia Element III (Plant)
- Marching Fishes, Hydro Water III (Water)
- Super Shocker, Thunder Fall III (Electric)
- Diamond Shell, Grand Rock III (Earth)
- Heaven's Knuckle, Holy Light III (Light)
- Nightmare III (Dark)

## Tips
- Use Digi-Lab to devolve/evolve freely and inherit moves.
- Prioritize Champion/Ultimate forms for stronger moves.
- Always check move inheritance before evolving to next stage.
