# Digimon Evolution in Cyber Sleuth

## Overview
Digivolution (evolution) in Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth is a core mechanic that allows Digimon to transform into stronger forms. The process is managed in the Digi-Lab, where players can digivolve or de-digivolve their Digimon, store them in the Digi-Bank, or send them to Digi-Farms for training.

## Evolution Stages
- **Fresh**
- **In-Training**
- **Rookie**
- **Champion**
- **Ultimate**
- **Mega**
- **Ultra** (some Digimon)

## Evolution Requirements
To digivolve, a Digimon must meet specific requirements:
- **Level**: Minimum level required for the next form.
- **Stats**: Certain ATK, DEF, INT, SPD, or HP/SP values.
- **CAM (Camaraderie)**: Some evolutions require a minimum CAM, which increases by having the Digimon in your active party during battles.
- **ABI (Ability)**: Higher forms often require a minimum ABI, which increases by digivolving/de-digivolving or creating Digimon with higher scan data.
- **Other**: Some require specific items or conditions.

## Branching Paths
- Digimon can have multiple possible evolutions at each stage, allowing for branching evolutionary trees.
- De-digivolving (reverting to a previous form) is possible if the Digimon has been recorded in the Field Guide.
- Each time a Digimon digivolves or de-digivolves, its level resets to 1, but its ABI and max level increase.

## Special Evolutions
- **DNA Digivolution**: Some Digimon (e.g., Omnimon) require two specific Digimon to combine.
- **Armor/Hybrid**: Some Digimon require special items or conditions.

## Training and Stats
- Stats are fixed per Digimon species, but bonus stats can be trained in Digi-Farms, based on ABI and personality.
- Maximum moves per Digimon: 20. Moves must be deleted if a Digimon learns more.

## Field Guide
- The Field Guide tracks all Digimon seen and their possible evolutions.
- The original Cyber Sleuth includes 249 Digimon; the Complete Edition adds 92 more from Hacker's Memory.

## Summary Table
| Stage      | Example Digimon | Requirements (Typical)         |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Fresh      | Pabumon         | None                           |
| In-Training| Motimon         | Level 3                        |
| Rookie     | Agumon          | Level 9                        |
| Champion   | Greymon         | Level 15, CAM 10%              |
| Ultimate   | MetalGreymon    | Level 30, CAM 25%, ABI 20      |
| Mega       | WarGreymon      | Level 50, CAM 80%, ABI 40      |
| Ultra      | Omnimon         | DNA Digivolution (WarGreymon + MetalGarurumon)

## Key Points
- Evolution is flexible and encourages experimentation.
- De-digivolving is useful for increasing ABI and unlocking new evolutionary paths.
- Some Digimon require high CAM/ABI, so repeated evolution and training are necessary.
