# Optimal Virus Digimon Evolution Path and Moveset (Cyber Sleuth)

## Evolution Path
**Start:** DemiDevimon (Rookie, Virus, Dark)
- Can inherit moves from other Virus forms by devolving/evolving repeatedly.

**Champion:** Devimon (Virus, Dark)
- Learns Dark moves (Nightmare, Death Claw), can inherit Fire, Plant, Electric, Wind, Water, Earth, and Light moves from other branches.

**Ultimate:** Myotismon (Virus, Dark)
- Learns powerful Dark moves (Nightmare III, Night Raid), can inherit all previous moves.

**Mega:** VenomMyotismon (Virus, Dark)
- Learns top-tier Dark moves (Nightmare III, Venom Infusion), inherits all previous moves.

## Move Inheritance Strategy
- **Dark moves:** Super effective against Light Vaccine Digimon (e.g., ShineGreymon, Ophanimon, Seraphimon, Justimon, Kentaurosmon, etc.).
- **Fire moves:** Super effective against Plant Vaccine Digimon (e.g., HerculesKabuterimon, Kabuterimon, MegaKabuterimon).
- **Plant moves:** Super effective against Water Vaccine Digimon (e.g., MarineAngemon, Zudomon).
- **Electric moves:** Super effective against Wind Vaccine Digimon (e.g., UlforceVeedramon, Crowmon).
- **Wind moves:** Super effective against Earth Vaccine Digimon (e.g., Craniamon, BanchoLeomon).
- **Water moves:** Super effective against Fire Vaccine Digimon (e.g., WarGreymon, Garudamon).
- **Earth moves:** Super effective against Electric Vaccine Digimon (e.g., MegaGargomon, HiAndromon).
- **Light moves:** Super effective against Dark Vaccine Digimon (rare, but possible via inheritance).

## Summary Table
| Move            | Attribute | Coverage (Vaccine Weakness) |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Nightmare III   | Dark      | Light Vaccine               |
| Meteor Fall II  | Fire      | Plant Vaccine               |
| Gaia Element III| Plant     | Water Vaccine               |
| Thunder Fall I  | Electric  | Wind Vaccine                |
| Gale Storm II   | Wind      | Earth Vaccine               |
| Ocean Wave I    | Water     | Fire Vaccine                |
| Grand Rock III  | Earth     | Electric Vaccine            |
| Holy Light III  | Light     | Dark Vaccine                |

## Optimal Strategy
- Use move inheritance to teach DemiDevimon moves of all elements by devolving/evolving through Virus branches.
- Evolve to VenomMyotismon for high stats and access to all inherited moves.
- Use Dark moves for Light Vaccine Digimon, Fire for Plant, Plant for Water, Electric for Wind, Wind for Earth, Water for Fire, Earth for Electric, and Light for Dark.
